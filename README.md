Pepecoin is a community focused cryptocurrency created by one of the original Dogecoin shibes from 2013. It was created for one purpose, to create a new and fun community just like the original Dogecoin community.

Unlike all iterations before it, Pepecoin is a layer 1 coin. This means there are no liquidity pools to drain, no blacklisting wallets, and no confusing smart contracts. Pepecoin is a simple blockchain.

The Pepecoin Core software allows anyone to operate a node in the Pepecoin blockchain networks and uses the Scrypt hashing method for Proof of Work. It is adapted from Dogecoin Core, Bitcoin Core, and other cryptocurrencies.

For information about the default fees used on the Pepecoin network, please
refer to the [fee recommendation](doc/fee-recommendation.md).

## Dogecoin Differences

Pepecoin is a fork of Dogecoin. For the sake of familiarity, we will attempt to keep Pepecoin similar to Dogecoin.

Changes:

* Addresses start with `P` instead of `D`
* BIPS features will start block 1000
* AuxPow starts at block 42,000 (Chain ID: 63)
* GUI themed for Pepecoin

## Usage 💻

To start your journey with Pepecoin Core, see the [installation guide](INSTALL.md) and the [getting started](doc/getting-started.md) tutorial.

The JSON-RPC API provided by Pepecoin Core is self-documenting and can be browsed with `pepecoin-cli help`, while detailed information for each command can be viewed with `pepecoin-cli help <command>`. Alternatively, see the [Bitcoin Core documentation](https://developer.bitcoin.org/reference/rpc/) - which implement a similar protocol - to get a browsable version.

### Ports

Pepecoin Core by default uses port `33874` for peer-to-peer communication that
is needed to synchronize the "mainnet" blockchain and stay informed of new
transactions and blocks. Additionally, a JSONRPC port can be opened, which
defaults to port `33873` for mainnet nodes. It is strongly recommended to not
expose RPC ports to the public internet.

| Function | mainnet | testnet | regtest |
| :------- | ------: | ------: | ------: |
| P2P      |   33874 |   44874 |   18444 |
| RPC      |   33873 |   44873 |   18332 |
